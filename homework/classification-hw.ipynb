    "Questions are based on the following task from [Steinmetz et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x): For a repeated series of trials, a mouse is trained to rotate a wheel to indicate whether it perceives a Gabor pattern to the left or right. Spike rates from many cortical neurons are recorded on each trial. The goal is to build a model that can predict the mouse's choice based on the spiking of its cortical neurons."
